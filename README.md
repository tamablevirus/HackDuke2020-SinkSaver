# Sink Saver

Our HackDuke 2020 project, titled Sink Saver, is focused on the Energy and Environment track. It is a hardware-based solution with the purpose of reducing the amount of water wasted by leaky faucets in a household. By sending text notifications to a user's phone whenever a camera near the sink detects a constant flow or drip of water from the faucet, it will encourage people to be mindful of their wasted water, creating a positive impact on the environment.
