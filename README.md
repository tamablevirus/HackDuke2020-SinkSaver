# Sink Saver

![Sink Saver Logo](./Sink%20Saver%20Logo.png)


Our HackDuke 2020 project, titled Sink Saver, is focused on the Energy and Environment track. It is a hardware-based solution with the purpose of reducing the amount of water wasted by leaky faucets in a household. By sending text notifications to a user's phone whenever a camera near the sink detects a constant flow or drip of water from the faucet for at least 10 seconds, it will encourage people to be mindful of their wasted water, creating a positive impact on the environment.

The web server code, which contains the Google Vision API and Twilio SMS API services that we used, can be found in `app.py` and the Arduino code that the Arduino UNO uses to communicate with the server can be found in the `Arduino` folder.
